I'll try to build a network described in this example using numpy:
https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/readings/gradient-notes.pdf
And may be try solving MNIST with it.


Update.
I went through the proofs in the dpf and they had multiple minor typos. 
I've made a similiar network and it nicely predicts whether number from [-1, 1] is > 0.
It's in draft.py. 

Next step is to change it a bit and solve MNIST.
